# Installation

> **Requirements:** [PHP 8.1+](https://php.net/releases/)

Installing ***fluentRegex*** is very simple, thanks to [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).  
Before you start, make sure you have PHP `8.1` or higher on your system.

**Firstly** run the command in your terminal.

```shell
composer require rudashi/fluent-regex
```

**Secondly**... that's all. You are now ready to work on regular expressions.

Once the installation is complete, you can start using [Fluent Regex â†’](usage).
